                                <h4>A lifetime horseback</h4>
                                <p> A lifetime horseback—from ranch cowboy to colt starter to performance horse trainer—teaches you a lot about equipment, including what works; 
                                    what to avoid; and, most important for Jim Edwards, what’s best for the horse </p>
                                <p>Jim came by bitmaking naturally. He learned from watching his father repair his own gear and build his own equipment out of necessity when working on remote ranches in New Mexico and West Texas. 
                                    Jim’s cowboy education continued as he worked cattle and trained horses in early adulthood, when he began to question conventional bridle bits and how horses reacted to them.  </p>

                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvEWRHHUe2g" class="tm-videobutton" data-fancybox>

                            </div>
                                <p>Bitmaking started as a lucrative side hustle, but as Jim honed his craft, it became his passion. 
                                    Jim moved from focusing on the cattle business when he and his wife and two sons settled in Blum, Texas, in 1992. Instead, Jim began developing his own bit designs for horsemen and horsewomen competing in the performance arena, mainly reining, working cow horse, and cutting. 
                                    Wanting to improve all horses’ experiences with bits, Jim moved into developing bits for the barrel racing and roping arenas, too.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>The difference in Jim’s bits comes from his appreciation for his horses. 
                            Jim believes conventional bits can lead a horse to become reactive instead of thinking. 
                            To Jim, tongue pressure, pain in the horse’s mouth, and inconsistencies in the rider’s hands can trigger an array of protective responses from the horse, which over time become bad habits and inhibit the horse’s natural abilities.</p>
